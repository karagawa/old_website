I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Environmental Science and Engineering. As a typical student majoring in environmental science & engineering, I started my Ph.D. studying career by venturing into a completely new research sphere: environmental economics. I am so fortunate to enter this research field under direction of my advisor, [Prof. Martin D. Heintzelman](http://people.clarkson.edu/~mheintze/) and to receive a great amount of advices and support from [Prof. Nicolai V. Kuminoff](http://www.public.asu.edu/~nkuminof/).

My Ph.D. research focuses on non-market valuation on ecosystem service and cost-benefit analysis in an effort to better manage natural resources and to navigate policy-making processes in a scientific manner. I also have strong interests in applying the concept of Big Data into scientific research fields.

Thanks for your interest on my research and blog posts. Please leave me a message if you have any questions about my research. I would like to communicate with you on topics in which I am interested.
