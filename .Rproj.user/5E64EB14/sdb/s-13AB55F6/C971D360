New York State has more than 7,600 freshwater lakes, ponds and reservoirs. These waterbodies often serve as drinking water supplies for local communities and as habitat for aquatic plants and animals. They also support a wide range of human activities, including recreation, tourism, agriculture, fishing, power generation and manufacturing. Impaired water quality in large lakes in New York State reduces their ecological services and value to homeowners and visitors. In this study, links between water quality and property values as a result of acid and mercury deposition in New York State is established through hedonic analysis. \n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"/assets/img/mercury.jpg\"><img src=\"/assets/img/mercury.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Total Mercury Wed Deposition 1999~2013 </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nHedonic analysis uses regression techniques to estimate a hedonic price function, which represents the impact of observable property characteristics, including environmental amenities and spatial factors, on the equilibrium prices of parcels. By including observable characteristics, like lot size, square footage, and some information about the buyer, including their mailing address, the project will also be able to estimate how water quality factors impact the values of different types of homes in different ways.\n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"/assets/img/hedonic.jpg\"><img src=\"/assets/img/hedonic.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hedonic Analysis   by Chuan Tang</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThis study is unique in its use of hedonic analysis to study these water quality factors and benefits from a large sample size and study area which allows for sufficient variation over both space and time in order to identify the effects on property values. In contrast to many previous hedonic studies, we use these specific measures, which have important ecosystem and human health implications, rather than clarity or other more aggregate measures for water quality. Moreover, this research will put dollar values to air pollution reductions, which is very useful in that it enables rigorous cost-benefit analyses to be performed as opposed to policymakers being forced to compare emissions controls cost figures from electric generating units with air and water quality metrics. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Comparative Analysis: Methods of Standardizing Fish Mercury\n\nEconomics valuations and further cost-benefit analysis based on environmental/biological monitoring data may reach spurious results and misleading conclusions if the true spatial and temporal trends are not properly distinguished from total variations of monitored objects complicated by sample heterogeneity. The research is an example of addressing this problem, aiming to provide credible data source for further economics valuations on mercury pollution. Consumption of mercury-contaminated fish is the major route through which human and wildlife are exposed to the threat of mercury. Unfortunately, effective economics analysis based on fish monitoring data is normally dampened by difficulties in distinguishing the true spatial and temporal trends from variation in fish-mercury concentrations caused by heterogeneity in fish samples(e.g., species, size, sex). \n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"http://emmma.usgs.gov/images/fish_animation.gif\"><img src=\"http://emmma.usgs.gov/images/fish_animation.gif\"></a><figcaption>Fish Standardization Animation(Source: USGS EMMMA)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThis research will put effort to evaluate the relative performance of several fish mercury standardization methods systematically: ANCOVA and Mutiple-Linear Regression, Bivariate Regression, Partial Least Squares Regression, Biotic Mercury Partitioning Index (BMPI)and the Empirical Transforming Model, serving as a clear guide to choose the “best” suitable model for further economics research involving fish mercury trend analysis. Results of this research will therefore contribute to (1) maximizing the utility of integrated monitoring databases with minimum uncertainty, (2) processing monitoring data efficiently and ensuring reliable trend analysis results which can be related back to economics valuations and emissions mitigation policies, and (3) proposing fish consumption advisories with validated references.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Towards the Measurement of the Value of Public Land Designations in the Adirondack Park\n\nThe six-million-acre Adirondack Park in New York State is the largest designated park in the contiguous United States, consisting of approximately three million acres of private lands, 2.6 million acres of public land plus water bodies. This region constitutes nearly 20 percent of the state’s land area and is a mix of dense forests, mountains, wetlands, lakes, rivers and streams, with a diverse population of wildlife and 130 rural communities, 10 of which are incorporated villages. The park has 130,000 year-round residents and 200,000 seasonal residents. It attracts 10 million annual visitors. The Adirondack Park is accessible to over 60 million people who live within a day’s drive. The abundant natural resources and large preserved wilderness area have made the Adirondack Park a famous destination for outdoor activities like hiking, fishing, boating, as well as a notable natural lab for education and scientific research. \n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.adventurecycling.org/default/assets/Image/Routes_Maps/Route_Photos/Adirondack_Park_Loop_DennisCoello.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.adventurecycling.org/default/assets/Image/Routes_Maps/Route_Photos/Adirondack_Park_Loop_DennisCoello.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Adirondack Park(Source: Adventure Cycling Association)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nNew York State continues to acquire additional land inside the Adirondack Park. The state recently bought much of the [former Finch, Pruyn lands](http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/42077.html) and will soon complete the purchase of the Boreas Ponds Tract. Once the state buys this tract, it’s up to the Adirondack Park Agency to determine how it will be managed by classifying it using one of the categories spelled out in the Adirondack Park State Land Master Plan. Broadly, Forest Preserve land can be designated as wilderness, which prohibits motorized recreation, or wild forest, which allows the use of motorized vehicles including snowmobiles, ATVs, and floatplanes. \n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"/assets/img/ADK_transaction.jpg\"><img src=\"/assets/img/ADK_transaction.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Property values in ADK   by Chuan Tang</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nGiven recent and expected acquisitions of former timberlands in the Adirondack Park, the New York State DEC must designate newly-acquired land under the SLMP. There is a heated political debate about which land designation would be most beneficial to the park’s communities and economy. This research is aiming to better understand the economic value provided to the park's residents and communities by the various land use designations, and it will use property value impacts as a guide.
